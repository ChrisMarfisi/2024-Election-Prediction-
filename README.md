# 2024-Election-Prediction-
In collaboration with Jarret Markman, we developed a model to predict the 2024 election using historical polling.

For a quick summary, we identified that Donald Trump had a 53% chance to win whereas Kamala Harris had a 45% chance to win. There were many possible permutations for each candidate to win, but the most likely scenerio our research found was Donald Trump winning Georgia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Nevada, getting him to 281 electoral votes to Harris' 257. As a note, we only measured our model on "swing state" polling data, as we identified that in this unusual election cycle, there was insufficient data for non-swing states.
